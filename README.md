# ADAPT it! Automating APT Campaign and Group Attribution by Linking Heterogeneous Files

Recent years have witnessed a surge in the growth of Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), with significant challenges to the security landscape, affecting industry, governance, and democracy. The ever-growing number of actors and the complexity of their campaigns have made it difficult for defenders to track and attribute these malicious activities effectively.
Traditionally, researchers relied on threat intelligence to track APTs. However, this often led to fragmented information, delays in connecting campaigns with specific threat groups, and misattribution.

In response to these challenges, we introduce ADAPT, a machine learning-based approach for automatically attributing APTs at two levels: (1) the threat campaign level, to identify samples with similar objectives and (2) the threat group level, to identify samples operated by the same entity. ADAPT supports a variety of heterogeneous file types targeting different platforms, including executables and documents, and uses linking features to find connections between them. We evaluate ADAPT on a reference dataset from MITRE as well as a comprehensive, label-standardized dataset of 6,134 APT samples belonging to 92 threat groups. Using real-world case studies, we demonstrate that ADAPT effectively identifies clusters representing threat campaigns and associates them with their respective groups.
